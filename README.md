# arxiv-jev-scan

Keep up with arXiv on one specific topic without reading hundreds of abstracts a day.

You describe the topic in a small YAML file, for example "papers about event cameras, and not about
events in the everyday sense". The scanner harvests new papers from the arXiv categories you choose
and asks [Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai), TypeSafe's classification model, whether each paper
matches. Papers that match are sorted into sub-topics. You browse the results in a small web
dashboard, download the PDFs you care about, and get a desktop notification when something new
shows up.

It is built for one person on one machine: SQLite for storage, Markdown notes for syncing to your
other devices, and no servers or accounts beyond a Jev API key.

## What it does

- Scans any arXiv categories (cs.CV, cs.RO, eess.IV, ...), from a one-off backfill of a whole
  year down to a quick daily update.
- Never sends the same paper to Jev twice, no matter how often you re-run a scan.
- Classifies in stages defined in YAML. The first stage is a yes/no relevance question with an
  accept / maybe / reject band, so borderline papers are kept for you to review instead of being
  dropped. Later stages only run for papers that passed, so a rejected paper costs a single call.
- Resumes an interrupted backfill from the last finished day.
- Shows every paper's per-stage answers, token usage and cost in the dashboard.
- Downloads PDFs one at a time or all at once, with polite rate limiting.
- Draws a network graph of related papers.
- Exports accepted papers as Markdown notes with YAML frontmatter, ready for Obsidian.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer
- A TypeSafe API key from https://console.typesafe.ai/keys

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/arxiv-jev-scan.git
cd arxiv-jev-scan

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env               # then put your API key in .env
```

## Describe your topic

Everything about a topic lives in `config/stages.yaml`. The file that ships with the project looks
for event camera papers:

```yaml
topic: Event cameras
data_dir: data

source:
  categories: [cs.CV, cs.RO]

stages:
  - name: relevance
    type: noul                 # a yes/no question
    instructions: >-
      Is this paper about event cameras, meaning neuromorphic vision sensors
      that report per-pixel brightness changes, or about processing the event
      streams they produce?
    criteria:
      true: The paper uses, studies, simulates or builds event cameras ...
      false: The paper does not involve event cameras. Event detection in ordinary video ...
    accept_threshold: 0.8      # probability >= 0.8 is accepted
    reject_threshold: 0.2      # probability <= 0.2 is rejected, anything in between is "maybe"

  - name: domain
    type: choice               # pick one option; likely options become tags
    instructions: What is the main application area of this event camera paper?
    criteria:
      Robotics: Robots, drones, autonomous driving, navigation or control
      Perception: Object detection, tracking, recognition or segmentation
      Imaging: Video or image reconstruction, deblurring, HDR ...
      Other: None of the areas above
```

Jev reads questions quite literally, so spell out what counts as yes and what counts as no. The
comments in the file explain each field.

Each paper is stored once and never classified again, so one config file means one topic. To follow
a second topic, copy the file, change `topic`, `data_dir` and the stages, and pass it with
`--config`. The dashboard lets you switch between config files.

## Usage

### A first try

Scan a few days, but stop after 20 new papers:

```bash
python -m scanner.cli scan --since 2026-09-20 --max 20
```

The output looks like this:

```
10:02:11 INFO    Scanning cs.CV, cs.RO for 'Event cameras' since 2026-09-20
10:02:21 INFO    arXiv 2026-09-20: 212 records in cs.CV, cs.RO
10:02:25 INFO    Reached the limit of 20 new papers, stopping
10:02:25 INFO    Done: 20 new papers, 1 accepted, 0 maybe, 19 rejected, 0 failed, cost $0.0003
10:02:25 INFO      accepted: Multi-viewpoint Geo-localization with Event Cameras
```

### A big backfill

```bash
python -m scanner.cli scan --since 2026-01-01
```

The scanner works through the date range one day at a time and saves a checkpoint after each day.
If you stop it with Ctrl+C, or your laptop goes to sleep, run the same command again and it picks
up where it stopped. Harvesting is limited by arXiv's rules (one request every three seconds), so a
year of cs.CV takes a while. Leave it running in a terminal.

### Daily updates

```bash
python -m scanner.cli scan
```

Without `--since`, the scan starts at the last day a previous scan finished. Papers already in the
database are skipped before any Jev call, so overlapping runs cost nothing.

### The dashboard

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This opens http://localhost:8501 in your browser. From there you can:

- start a scan from the sidebar, either "since the last scan" or for a date range
- see totals for papers, tokens and cost
- browse the Relevant, Maybe and Rejected tabs, and click a row to see the abstract, each stage's
  decision, the relevance probability and the sub-topic probabilities
- download a single PDF, or all of them with "Download all PDFs"
- open the Graph tab, where you choose how papers are connected: through shared tag hubs, directly
  to their most similar papers, or through tag hubs plus shared authors

### PDFs and notes

```bash
python -m scanner.cli download-all                    # PDFs of accepted papers
python -m scanner.cli download-all --status accepted,maybe
python -m scanner.cli export                          # Obsidian notes, also done after every scan
python -m scanner.cli stats                           # totals and recent scans
```

`download-all` skips papers whose PDF is already downloaded, so running it again only fetches what
is missing.

## Where your data goes

```
data/
  papers.db        SQLite database: papers, every Jev answer, scan runs
  pdfs/            downloaded PDFs, named after the arXiv id
  obsidian/        one Markdown note per accepted paper
```

`data/` is in `.gitignore`. To read your papers on another device, open `data/obsidian` as an
Obsidian vault, or sync it with git, Dropbox or Obsidian Sync.

## Running on a schedule

arXiv announces new papers on weekday evenings (US Eastern time), so a morning run picks up each
new batch.

Linux and macOS, with `crontab -e`:

```
0 8 * * * cd /path/to/arxiv-jev-scan && DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/$(id -u)/bus .venv/bin/python -m scanner.cli scan >> data/scan.log 2>&1
```

The `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` part is Linux-only. Cron jobs don't see your desktop session, and
without it the notification can't be shown. The scan runs either way. On macOS, notifications
through `plyer` need `pyobjus`; without it you only get the log.

Windows, in a terminal:

```
schtasks /Create /SC DAILY /ST 08:00 /TN arxiv-jev-scan ^
  /TR "cmd /c cd /d C:\path\to\arxiv-jev-scan && .venv\Scripts\python -m scanner.cli scan >> data\scan.log 2>&1"
```

## Costs

Jev charges for input tokens only. At the time of writing it costs $0.042 per million tokens for
`jev-1.13`, and output tokens are free. A title plus abstract plus the question comes to roughly
300 to 400 tokens, so classifying a thousand papers costs about one or two cents. The cost shown in
the dashboard uses the price set in `.env` (`JEV_PRICE_PER_MILLION_INPUT_TOKENS`). Change it there
if your price is different.

## How it works

1. **Harvest.** Papers come from arXiv's [OAI-PMH](https://info.arxiv.org/help/oa/index.html)
   interface, one category set and one day at a time. This is arXiv's official bulk metadata
   service. The search API (`export.arxiv.org/api/query`) has been rejecting most automated
   date-range queries with HTTP 406, so it isn't used. Revisions of old papers also show up in the
   harvest and are skipped.
2. **Dedup.** Every paper id is inserted into SQLite first. Only ids the database has never seen
   continue.
3. **Classify.** Each new paper goes through the stages in order, one Jev call per stage, with ten
   papers in parallel. The first `reject` stops the paper. The answers, tokens and cost of every
   call are stored.
4. **Checkpoint.** After each finished day the scan records that day, so an interrupted run
   continues from there.
5. **Export and notify.** Accepted papers are written as Markdown notes, and if any are new you get
   a desktop notification.

The design decisions and their trade-offs are written up in
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

```

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest
```

The tests use canned arXiv responses and a mocked Jev API, so they run offline in about a second.

## Adding another source

Write a class that extends `PaperSource` in `scanner/sources/` and implements
`fetch_day(categories, day)`, returning a list of `Paper` objects. The pipeline, database and
dashboard don't need to change.

## Ideas for later

- A second pass that reads the full PDF text to find richer connections between papers than
  shared tags.
- More sources, such as OpenReview and bioRxiv.
